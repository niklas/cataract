      <p>This site has been created as an open-source example of creating an app using the Hobo framework. It's at a very early stage at the moment, and, as you have probably noticed, there's not a lot of data!</p>

      <p>The source code to this app is available <a href="http://dev.hobocentral.net/trac/browser/trunk/hobocentral">here</a></p>
